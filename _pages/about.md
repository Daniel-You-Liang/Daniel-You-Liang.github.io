I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Rice University under the supervision of Dr. Nai-Hui Chia. Previously, I did my PhD at UT Austin under the gracious supervision of Dr. Scott Aaronson. Prior to that, I received a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering from Cornell University in both Computer Science and Engineering Physics.

Research Interests
======
My focus is on the application of both classical and quantum statistical/computational learning theory to quantum problems. During my PhD, I focused on leveraging both analytic and algebraic properties of the stabilizer formalism to tackle topics such as PAC/SQ/Agnostic learning, property testing, tomography, and pseudorandomness. I am additionally broadly interested in quantum cryptography and pseudorandom quantum states, quantum query complexity, general quantum machine learning, and quantum complexity theory.
